"""
Reverse the extracted chainage direction and tag real Pune localities
onto it, so the reach reads the way people actually think of it:

    Sangam (confluence, upstream end, chainage 0)
      -> Bund Garden -> Dhanori -> Wadgaon Sheri -> Kharadi
      -> Mundhwa -> Hadapsar -> Manjari (downstream end)

Why: extract_centerline.py's Voronoi-skeleton walk has no idea which
end of the traced polygon is "upstream" -- it just picked one leaf
node as station 0. In this KML that happened to put chainage 0 at the
Manjari/Hadapsar (downstream) end and the max chainage at Sangam
(upstream, the real confluence). This script:

  1. Reverses naditwin/chainage_profile.json so chainage 0 m is at the
     Sangam end and chainage increases downstream (matches the real
     flow direction of the combined Mula-Mutha).
  2. Snaps each named locality (given as an approximate real-world
     lon/lat) to its nearest station on the *new* chainage and records
     the offset -> naditwin/landmarks.json.
  3. Leaves reach_polygon.json untouched (it's just the traced outline,
     order-independent for rendering).

The original (un-reversed) profile is kept as
naditwin/chainage_profile_original.json so this is easy to undo.

Run once: `python3 reverse_and_tag_landmarks.py`
Needs only the standard library.
